This is an unauthorized (and hopefully temporary) fork of:

<https://code.google.com/p/enh/>

I have made the following fixes/enhancements:

* [support latest Android SDK](https://code.google.com/p/enh/issues/detail?id=37)
* [literal percent needs to be doubled in format string](https://code.google.com/p/enh/issues/detail?id=38)
* [sensors fluctuate wildly; report data in wrong units](https://code.google.com/p/enh/issues/detail?id=39)
* [show API level in BuildActivity](https://code.google.com/p/enh/issues/detail?id=40)
* new Activity for showing TLS protocols and ciphersuites
* new Activity for showing cryptography Providers

I hope to get these accepted upstream, in which case this repo will
become irrelevant.  Or if my changes aren't accepted, then I'll change
the name of my fork to something other than dalvik-explorer to avoid
confusion.  (Okay, I've already halfway renamed it, but I'd need to
finish the job.)  But meanwhile this repo is in a bit of a state of
limbo and shouldn't be considered a release of any sort.  I'm mostly
putting this up on Github because my boss saw the modified version
running on my phone and said, "Hey, I want that app!"

Although this is not a release, an APK is available here:
